### Hello World 👋

I am a graduate student at the University of Buffalo, pursuing Masters in Computer Science and Engineering. Previously, I worked in the tech industry for over 3.5 years ([Unisys](https://www.unisys.com/)) on several enterprise-grade products ranging across different teams ([ClearPath ePortal](https://www.unisys.com/offerings/clearpath-forward/brochure/the-unisys-clearpath-forward-eportal-for-mcp-and-os-2200-environments-id-544), [Stealth](https://stealthsecurity.unisys.com/products-services/)). <br>

My expertise includes building large-scale enterprise software using best practices and engineering principles in a modern, well-structured process. Additionally, I possess extensive knowledge of the software development cycle as well as proficiency in several programming languages and frameworks including but not limited to - C#.NET, Asp.NET Core, Angular, TypeScript, C++, Python, PyTorch. <br>

Above all, I’m a highly enthusiastic and conscientious programmer who loves to learn new stuff. I believe in constant learning, problem-solving and developing code that solves real-world problems. <br>
